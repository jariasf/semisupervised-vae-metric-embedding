# Datasets

This folder contains the datasets used to evaluate our model, currently we tested with the following datasets:

### MNIST

- The MNIST dataset consists of 70000 handwritten digits of 28Ã—28 pixel size and 10 classes, of which 60000 images are considered for training and 10000 images for testing.

- This dataset can be obtained directly from the keras framework.

### SVHN

- The SVHN dataset consists of 73257 house number digits for training and of 26032 for testing. Unlike MNIST, the images are colored with 32x32x3 pixel size.

- This dataset can be downloaded from [http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/). The files should be downloaded inside the *svhn* folder. Create the folder if needed.
